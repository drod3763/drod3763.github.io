    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that originated in Japan and was polished in South America. Like most
      martial arts its about using skill and leverage to defeat much stronger opponents.

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>
      Since I have started training, it has increased my confidence which leads to a bunch of other supplemental
      benefits.

    <h3>Life Experiences</h3>
    <p>
      Because of my interest in this art I have traveled to Rio de Janeiero, Brazil multiple times and participated in
      activites I might not have done otherwise. While I was there I climbed my first (and only) mountain, Padre la
      Gavea as part of training.
